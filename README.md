## Hi there 👋

Hi there! I’m Marco! I have a degree in New Communication Technologies from the University of
Aveiro, which I completed a few years ago (2017 - 2020). My education strengthened my passion
for programming and design, and now I'm eager to put my skills to use and make a real
difference in the world.


I was born and raised in the small town of Vizela, but I've always had big dreams for my future.
I'm on a journey to build a career that allows me to be creative, innovative, and make an impact.

I couldn’t be more excited to see what the future holds for me, and I hope to have a lot of
opportunities to work on projects that push the boundaries of what s possible.
