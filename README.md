## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! Iâ€™m Marco! I have a degree in New Communication Technologies from the University of
Aveiro, which I completed a few years ago (2017 - 2020). My education strengthened my passion
for programming and design, and now I'm eager to put my skills to use and make a real
difference in the world.


I was born and raised in the small town of Vizela, but I've always had big dreams for my future.
I'm on a journey to build a career that allows me to be creative, innovative, and make an impact.

I couldnâ€™t be more excited to see what the future holds for me, and I hope to have a lot of
opportunities to work on projects that push the boundaries of what s possible.

 - I'm watching a portuguese crime show called ["O Americano"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21990710/), which translates to "The American"
 - I'm also trying to play the top 10 games that came out of the [JS13kGames Game Jam](https://js13kgames.com/2024/blog/winners-announced). Been thinking about joining the game jam and try to submit my own game.
